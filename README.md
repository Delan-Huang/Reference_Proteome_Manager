# Reference_Proteome_Manager
Program to allow researchers to download and maintain protein databases from the UniProt database site for proteomics research.

## User Guide
A User Guide is included in each program's directory to help users. Please check those out for more detailed information on how to use the program.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This program was written using Python v.3.6.2.
It has been tested with Windows 7, Windows 10, and macOS 10.12.6.
The dependent files are "fasta_lib_Py3.py", "reverse_fasta.py", and "all_contams_fixed.fasta" 
which are required in order for "reference_proteome_manager_UniProt.py" to run with all features.
Many program features will work without a contaminants FASTA file. A different contaninants
FASTA file can be used provided the name is kept as "all_contams_fixed.fasta".
